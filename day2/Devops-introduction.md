# DevOps 

**DevOps** is a set of practices and a culture that unites software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to deliver applications and services more quickly and reliably. 

## Devops is a culture

### Flow  
Ensures smooth and fast movement of work from development to operations by reducing bottlenecks, using automation, and maintaining a steady delivery pipeline.

### Feedback  
Provides quick, continuous information from every stage of the pipeline so teams can identify issues early, improve code quality, and enhance user experience.

### Continuous Experimentation and Learning  
Encourages teams to try new ideas, learn from failures, refine processes, and innovate continuously, creating a culture of improvement and resilience.

## The Infinite Loop

## Plan
  Define requirements, project goals, and workflow before development starts.

## Code
  Write application code, follow version control, and maintain coding standards.

## Build
  Compile source code, resolve dependencies, and generate build artifacts.

## Test
  Run automated/manual tests to ensure functionality, performance, and quality.

## Release
  Prepare validated builds for production with proper approvals and versioning.

## Deploy
  Push releases into production environments—automated, repeatable, and reliable.

## Operate
  Manage and maintain applications in production, ensuring smooth operation.

## Monitor 
  Track performance, logs, and user experience to detect issues and improve the system.

## DevOps Metrics

DevOps metrics are key data points that show how well a DevOps pipeline is performing. They help teams quickly identify bottlenecks, improve workflows, and enhance overall delivery efficiency. These metrics measure both technical performance and team processes.

###  Deployment Frequency  
  How often you deploy code to production.  
  - **High**: Fast delivery, mature automation, efficient workflow.  
  - **Low**: Slower releases, possible process bottlenecks.

### Lead Time for Changes
  Time taken for a code change to go from commit to production.  
  - **Low**: Quick development cycle, smooth CI/CD pipeline.  
  - **High**: Delays in coding, testing, or deployment stages.

### Change Failure Rate
  Percentage of deployments that cause failures like bugs, outages, or rollbacks.  
  - **Low**: Good code quality, reliable pipeline and testing.  
  - **High**: Frequent issues after deployment, need for better testing and reviews.

### Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
  Time required to recover from a production failure.  
  - **Low**: Strong monitoring, quick incident response, robust systems.  
  - **High**: Slow recovery processes, poor observability, weak incident management.

## Summary

DevOps is a collaborative approach that unifies development and operations to streamline software delivery. It emphasizes automation, continuous integration, continuous delivery, rapid feedback, and ongoing improvement. The goal is to deliver high-quality software faster and more reliably.

DevOps metrics help measure how effectively the DevOps process is performing. Key metrics such as deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, and mean time to recovery highlight the speed, quality, and stability of software delivery. Tracking these metrics allows teams to identify bottlenecks, improve workflows, reduce failures, and ensure a resilient production environment.
